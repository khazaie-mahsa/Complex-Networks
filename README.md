# Gintropy Implementation

This implementation is based on Biró et al[1]. The paper is proposing a new measure to compute the heterogeneity of
complex networks
that combines entropy and Gini index called *Gintropy*. The authors then calculated Gini index and Gintropy for a set of
different
communities to indicate how heterogeneous is wealth distribution in those communities. This is a very intuitive approach
since
we all have a sense of how wealth distribution is different in different societies. Take a communist society as an
example. We expect
that heterogeneity index should be 0 zero or near zero for this community. And ofcourse on the other side we have a
capitalist society
for which we expect to get a high heterogeneity index.
In this implementation, I am trying to show that although the authors' view has been purely mathematical,
This implementation consists of two parts:

1. Fitting different network models (BA, WS,...) to represent different communities discussed in the paper
   (capitalist, communist, natural and eco-window) and verifying that the networks actually represents the said
   community bt
   calculating their Gintropy and Gini index to see if the values are close to what we should get according to Biró et
   al (See section # of the paper).
2. Using Generative GNNs to create those networks instead of figuring out the parameters ourselves.

The second approach requires that we acquire the wealth distribution data of the said communities, which comes with it's
own
set of challenges and limitations.

# Model Fitting Approach

Communities that were studied are:
1. **Extreme communism:** giving every person the same income
2. **Communism++:** a divided society defining two classes of the previous case with a fixed share
3. **Eco-window:** providing equal probability to any income in a fixed, but possibly even an infinite interval -> 
4. **Natural:** exponentially distributed income
5. **Capitalism:** the Pareto-distribution characteristic to capitalism

The following table shows degree distributions and my choice of modeling each case:

| Community   | Degree distribution                                                                | Model                                                                                               | Description                                                               |

# Graph Neural Network Approach

As far as I'm aware, all GNN models that generate graphs, need an input graph to be trained on. I am going to explore
two approaches and train on two sets of inputs:

1. Using previously discussed models (e.g. BA model to represent capitalist society).
2. Finding a dataset that represents wealth distribution in a society based on real-world data.

The fist approach is fairly straight-forward.
Regarding the second approach, I was able to find the statistics for [wealth distribution in the US since
1989](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/dataviz/dfa/distribute/chart/)

I used this data to create a graph in which **the degree distribution represents the wealth distribution** of a
capitalist society.
I chose to study wealth distribution in the first quarter of 2024 (2024:Q1 in the chart below). It's worth mentioning
that this data
can be used to model wealth distribution as a _temporal network_ and study how it has changed to gain more insight
into how wealth distribution
impacts other the society overtime.

![dataset.jpg](figures/dataset.jpg)

This is the data for the first quarter of 2024:

```csv

```

In this study, I'm only going to focus on net-worth however, other factors provided in this dataset are highly valuable
as well and
can be subject of subsequent studies.

It can be seen that we have the following:

- Top 0.1%, have 13.6% of the total networth
- Top 99-99.9%, have 16.8% of the total networth
- 90-99%, have 36.6% of the total networth
- 50-90%, have 30.5% of the total networth
- The bottom 50%, have 2.5% of the total networth

So in a 1000-person community:
- 1 person has 13.6% of the total wealth
- 9 people have 16.8% of the total wealth
- 90 people have 36.6% of the total wealth
- 900 people have 30.5% of the total wealth
- 500 people have 2.5% of the total wealth

If we think of:

- nodes as people in the society
- edges as wealth
  Then it's trivial to say that degree distribution between nodes of the graph could represent wealth distribution in
  that society.

For a community of 10 we compute degree of each node:

```python
total_nodes = 1000
category_networth['Category'] = total_nodes / 1000 * category_networth['Category'].astype(int)
# for the top 0.1% have:
# 1000/1000 * 13.6 = 13.6
# result for 1000 nodes:
# [13, 13, 13, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 36, 36, 36, 36, 36, 36, 36, 36, 36, 36, 36, 36, 36, 36, 36, 36, 36, 36, 36,

Now let's see how the graph turns out:

#### Network1: 10 nodes

![final_graph_10.png](figures/final_graph_10.png)

#### Network2: 100 nodes

![final_graph_100.png](figures/final_graph_100.png)

#### Network3: 1000 nodes

![final_graph_1000_small.png](figures/final_graph_1000_small.png)

#### Network4: 3000 nodes

![final_3000_graph.png](figures/final_3000_graph.png)

## Training

I used [NetGAN](https://github.com/mmiller96/netgan_pytorch) [2] with the following parameters for training:

```python
max_iterations = 20000,
rw_len = 12,
batch_size = 128,
H_gen = 40,
H_disc = 30,
H_inp = 128,
z_dim = 16,
lr = 0.0003,
n_critic = 3,
gp_weight = 10.0,
betas = (.5, .9),
l2_penalty_disc = 5e-5,
l2_penalty_gen = 1e-7,
temp_start = 5.0,
val_share = 0.2,
test_share = 0.1,
seed = 20
```

### Result

Results for training on Network3 (1000 nodes):
![results_1000.png](figures/result/results_1000.png)

Results of training on Network4 (3000 nodes):

```commandline
roc: 0.5233   avp: 0.5155   eo: 0.0090
finished after 799 iterations
```

As you can see, the average_precision is pretty unsatisfactory, so I perhaps should try changing hyperparameters of
training to
see if I can achieve better evaluation metrics.

Next steps:
1. Use an exponential distribution for `Natural` community using `configuration_model` of networkx
2. Verify that the graph created from real-world data actually represents the data
3. Tune hyperparameters of the model for better Average Precision
4. Try other evaluation metrics such as F1-score
5. Finally, use the synthetic graphs generated by NetGAN to measure Gintropy and Gini index of the graph and check
   to see if the values are persistent with table 1.
